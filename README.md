# Explaining Machine Learning
"What do you do ?" is the question we sometimes have a hard time answering as data scientists and ml researchers. This project tries to answer this very question with at least two levels of abstraction: casual learner, and programmer/math savy learner. 

You've stumbled upon the repository containing the code related to the following article: [ARTICLELINK]. If you're interested, we invite you to read the article as it will put everything into context. The analysis and predictive models that you can find here are meant to support the article and were not meant to be the best possible, but a mere glimpse into what Data Scientists are brought to do on a daily basis.

Do not hesitate to open issues on the project to correct our mistakes as there most probably are some !

Thanks, and have a fun read.
